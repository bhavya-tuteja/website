    <h1>About Web Development</h1>
    <p>Web development is the building and maintenance of websites; it’s the work that happens behind the 
        scenes to make a website look great, work fast and perform well with a seamless user experience<br>
        Web developers, or ‘devs’, do this by using a variety of coding languages. The languages they use 
        depends on the types of tasks they are preforming and the platforms on which they are working<br>
        Web development skills are in high demand worldwide and well paid too – making development a great career option.
        It is one of the easiest accessible higher paid fields as you do not need a traditional university degree to become qualified.<br>
