    <h1>Pseudo-classes</h1>
    A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special
    state of the selected element(s).<br />
    <br />
    For example, :hover can be used to change a button's color when the user's
    pointer hovers over it.
    <strong
      >For Example: /* Any button over which the user's pointer is hovering */
      button:hover { color: blue; }
    </strong>
    Note: In contrast to pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements can be used to style a
    specific part of an element.
