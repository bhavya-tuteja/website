    <!--Use of style tag is applying the effect of background and color on TAG 1 AND TAG 3 
        TAG 2  is not effected by the internal css property 
        because TAG 2 is specified with the backgournd and color command-->
    <!--It is internal css command.  To understand we will  the command as
    <style>
      h1 {
        background-color: blue;
        color: burlywood;
      }
    </style>

    <!--create a document with tag h1
         In order to apply css effect externally
         we  will create a file with extension css
         the new css file will be linked to main file with its command-->

    <h1>Good day, Sir.(TAG 1)</h1>
    <!--to add inline css  add background and color in side the h1 tag as follows
    Start with style Then background color is red and color is white-->
    <h1 style="background-color: brown; color: cornsilk">
      Good Day, Sir. Today is Friday. TAG 2
    </h1>
    <p>
      In the above css command in h1 tag. The commond is only in second h1 tag.
      <br />
      There is no effect of the "TAG 1". To understand the inline command we
      take one more h1 tag
    </p>
    <h1>Ok It is a test with "TAG 3".</h1>
    <!-- If we want to set the background command and color command to all the three h1 tags follow as below:
          Add a style tag in head tag-->
