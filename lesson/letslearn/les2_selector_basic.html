    <h3>CSS SELECTORS CATEGORY- 2</h3>
    <h1>COMBINATOR SELECTORS</h1>
    <strong>COMBINATOR HAS FOUR TYPES</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Descendant Seletor (Space)</li>
      <li>Child Selector (>)</li>
      <li>Adjacent Siblin Selectors (+)</li>
      <li>General Sibling Selector (~)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In <strong>DESCENDANT SELETOR (SPACE)</strong> ; we take a div with a
      class = "box".<br />
      In the div create two paragraphs and an additional div <br />
      Name the div as "under-box". Create two paragraphs naming <br />
      "Under-box=one" & another paragraph named="Under-box-two."
      <div class = "box">
               <p>It is first para named Para 1<br>
                  It is 'first imidiate child' of 'div class= box'. </p> 
               <p>It is second para named Para 2<br>
                   It is 'second imidiate child' of 'div class box'</p> 
                      <div class="under-box">
                              <p>It another paragraph in under-Box.  The name of para is under-box-para1</p>
                              <p>In one more paragraph in under-box.  Tne mame of para  is under-box-para2</p>
                            </div>
    </div>
     </p>
               <p>Now in the next step of working in css file we follow the following steps. <br>
                   Step 1 : Create a command as ' div.box p{ color:red; and background-color:lightblue;} '
              </p>
              <h2>CHILD SELECTOR '>'</h2>
                      <P>
                          In this Option we find that the command is limited to the "IMIDIATE DIRECT CHILD", <br>
                          The command is in the following way: <br>
                          In the command we give one addition character '>' for the 'imidiate direct child'. <br>
                          The command is as-  "div.box>p"                         </P>
                <h2>ADJACENT SIBLING SELECTOR (+)</h2>
                          <P>In this option we use a character '+'<br>

                    <div>
