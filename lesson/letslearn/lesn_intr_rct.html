    <h2>ABOUT REACT</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>
        Component Based Approach:</strong></li>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>A Component is on the core building blocks of React.</li>
          <li>
            In other words, we can say that everey application you will develop
            in React will be made up of pieces called components.
          </li>
          <li>Components make the task of building UIs much easier.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li><strong>PRACTICAL : TO HAVE KNOW-HOW OF REACT.JS</strong>
          <ol type="a">
            <li>Let us stduy a structure: with three main parts navbar, sidebar and main part of a web-site. </li>
            <li>Repeatition of job: In a website we have many components which are being repeated.</li>
            <li>Let us say: In main suppose div contains heading paregraph. (DIV, H1, P with images) </li>
            <li>Step 1: We create a part of component ( DIV, H1, Image and p).  Let us call it "CARD".</li>
            <li>Step 2: In order to use the "CARD". We can use it any number of times.</li>
            <li>Step 3: We can furthur can create components of h1 (HEADING).</li>
            <li>Step 4: Paragraph can be furtherr created a new component p(PARAGRAPH) </li>
            <li>Step 5: Image can be fruther a new component (IMAGE)</li>
