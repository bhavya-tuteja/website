            <h1>E COMMERCE</h1>
            <p> E-commerce (electronic commerce) is the activity of electronically buying <br>
            or selling of products on online services or over the Internet. <br>
            The term was coined and first employed by Dr. Robert Jacobson,<br>
            Principal Consultant to the California State Assembly's Utilities & Commerce Committee,<br>
            in the title and text of California's Electronic Commerce Act,<br>
            carried by the late Commmittee Chairwoman Gwen Moore (D-L.A.) and enacted in 1984.<br>
            Electronic commerce draws on technologies such as mobile commerce, electronic funds transfer<br>
            supply chain management, Internet marketing, online transaction processing, electronic data <br>
            interchange (EDI), inventory management systems, and automated data collection systems.<br>
            E-commerce is in turn driven by the technological advances of the semiconductor industry,<br>
            and is the largest sector of the electronics industry.
